    <content type="html">			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/people/160644704@N05/"&gt;Beardy Vulcan II&lt;/a&gt; posted a photo:&lt;/p&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/160644704@N05/51892262742/" title="Dalek Ambush?"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51892262742_8bf610a494_m.jpg" width="240" height="157" alt="Dalek Ambush?" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing inspirations from the real-life example of the Nazis, the Daleks are merciless and pitiless cyborg aliens, demanding total conformity, bent on conquest of the universe and the extermination of what they see as inferior races. Their catchphrase, &amp;quot;Exterminate!&amp;quot;, is a well-recognised reference in British popular culture. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Within the programme's narrative, the Daleks were engineered by the scientist Davros during the final years of a thousand-year war between his people, the Kaleds, and their enemies the Thals. With some Kaleds already badly mutated and damaged by nuclear war, Davros genetically modified the Kaleds and integrated them with a tank-like, robotic shell, removing their every emotion apart from hate. His creations soon came to view themselves as the supreme race in the universe, intent on purging the universe of all non-Dalek life. Collectively they are the greatest enemies of Doctor Who's protagonist, the Time Lord known as The Doctor. Later in the programme's history, the Daleks acquired time travel technology and engaged the Time Lords in a brutal Time War affecting most of the universe, with battles taking place across all of history. They are among the show's most popular villains and their various returns to the series over the years have typically been widely reported in the television press. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Amy Pond, also known as Amelia Pond, is a fictional character portrayed by Karen Gillan. The Amy here is a Charity Dalek Squad look-alike. Amy was a companion of the Doctor, in his eleventh incarnation, played by Matt Smith. She appears in the programme from the fifth series (2010) to midway through the seventh series (2012). &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Doctor is the title character and protagonist in the long-running BBC science fiction television programme Doctor Who. The character has also been featured in one made-for-television film, and a vast range of spin-off novels, audio dramas and comic strips. In the programme, &amp;quot;the Doctor&amp;quot; is the alias assumed by a centuries-old alien who travels through space and time in his TARDIS, frequently with companions. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Incedently the planet Altair IV has nothing to do with Dr Who but was the planet in the film Forbidden Planet (also known as Fatal Planet) which was a 1956 American science fiction film from MGM. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An Exoplanet such as Altair IV could actually exist as the star exists in reality. Altair also designated Alpha Aquilae, is the brightest star in the constellation of Aquila and the twelfth brightest star in the night sky. It is currently in the G-cloud—a nearby accumulation of gas and dust known as an interstellar cloud. Altair is an A-type main sequence star with an apparent visual magnitude of 0.77 and is one of the vertices of the asterism known as the Summer Triangle (the other two vertices are marked by Deneb and Vega). It is 16.7 light-years (5.13 parsecs) from the Sun and is one of the closest stars visible to the naked eye.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The building here is the Winchester Science Centre (previously known as INTECH) which is a hands-on, interactive, science and technology centre located in Morn Hill, just outside the city of Winchester in Hampshire, England. Opened in 2002 after major grants from amongst others the Millennium Commission, IBM, SEEDA and Hampshire County Council it replaced an existing facility in a more functional building in Winchester. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The centre houses over 100 activities, all of which link in with the National Curriculum for schools. During term time it is used mainly by local schools and days out, while at week ends and holidays it attracts a wider audience. The dome is now a state-of-the-art digital planetarium seating 176. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Daleks here and other characters here are part of the Charity Dalek Squad. After spending many years of attending and organising Doctor Who / Dalek events, the founder felt like he wanted to do more than just trundle around in his own Dalek. he could see how popular Daleks were and thought how they could be used to help raise money for Charities and good causes. He then contacted other Dalek owners and asked for their help. So the Charity Dalek Squad was formed. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Since their formation the squad has added Approximately 25 Daleks to it’s numbers. Of which, about half are regularly out at shows helping raising funds and entertaining huge crowds. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Due to it’s success, the squad has added other Doctor Who Monsters to it’s numbers, such like Miss Hartigan, Cybermen, Cybershades, Clockwork Droid and Scarecrow. They even have our own Doctor Who, Rose Tyler and of course Amy Pond impersonators!&lt;br /&gt;
